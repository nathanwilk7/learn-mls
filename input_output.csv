# does not consider players in game
# requires at least three previous games as input when testing (could make this a hyperparameter and grid search on it)
# could use probabilities to assign win, tie, loss
# should include how long ago last three games were (teams get tired)
# i believe home/away advantage would be captured
# could generate this data for all games after week X in each season which would give us a bunch of training data
# does it consider things like some team having a crazy home crowd?
